    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Green Haven Garden, a place where passion for nature blossoms into beautiful spaces. Our journey began with a simple love for plants and the joy they bring to everyday life. We believe that a garden is more than just soil and greenery—it’s a sanctuary where you can relax, breathe fresh air, and connect with nature.
    At Green Haven, we share tips, ideas, and inspiration to help you create your own peaceful garden, whether it’s a small balcony setup or a spacious backyard. From vibrant flowers and lush plants to sustainable gardening practices, our mission is to make gardening easy and enjoyable for everyone.
    Together, let’s nurture the earth and grow happiness, one plant at a time</p>
